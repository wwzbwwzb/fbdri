FBDRI than under X, like directly writing to texture memory over mmio,

<H1>INTRODUCTION:</H1>

FBDRI is an easy way to support 3D graphics in the Framebuffer console,
yet it is not a new OpenGL implementation written from scratch.<P>

Rather we reused the GLX and XF86DRI code and performed significant
modifications to run it independantly of a 2D windowing system. 
Despite the modifications, the reuse of XF86DRI makes it possible to
support 3D in the framebuffer console shortly after any new X windows
driver comes out.<P>


Although the current FBDRI draft relies on SDL for visual
initialization and user input, FBDRI is designed to function
independant and parallel of the windowing system, thus there are no SDL
dependancies in it.  You could easily write your own initialization
calls to the framebuffer device and transfer control to pure FBDRI in
less than 64k of memory.<P>


<HR>



<H1>INSTALLATION OF FBDRI:</H1>
<P>

Currently FBDRI only works with the following chipset:<P>

<B>
ATI Radeon with 64MB<BR>
ATI Radeon with 32MB<BR>

</B>
<P>

Since we're not planning to use any other chipset at the office,
further ports would have to come from outside.<P>

Either way, our installation directions are specific to <B>radeon</B>.<P>

Sourcecode to download:<P>



<A HREF="fbdri.082701.tar.bz2">FBDRI tarball</A><P>


This contains an <B>SDL</B> and a <B>DRI</B> directory.  They should
both get uncomressed side by side somewhere.  Then you should make in
SDL and make in DRI.<P>

Once the top level Makefiles are finished, go into
<B>dri/os-support/linux/drm/kernel</B> and run <B>make</B> again.<P>

So now you have four important objects:<P>

<B>sdl/src/.libs/libSDL*</B> - SDL windowing system hacked for FBDRI.<BR>
<B>dri/i686/libglfb.so</B> - OpenGL implementation using FBDRI.<BR>
<B>dri/i686/kernel/radeonfb.o</B> - kernel framebuffer driver hacked to enable bus mastering.<BR>
<B>dri/os-support/linux/drm/kernel/radeon.o</B> - kernel DRI/DRM driver hacked for FBDRI.<BR>
<P>


If it succeeded in building a test program, congratulations, otherwise
you'll have to write your own test program.<P>

To run the test program you need to load some kernel modules.<P>

<B>insmod i686/kernel/radeonfb.o</B> This probably depends on packed
pixel modules in your <B>/lib/modules</B> directory.  Obviously your
kernel needs <B>support for framebuffer devices</B> enabled.<P>

<B>insmod os-support/linux/drm/kernel/radeon.o</B><P>




<P>

Edit the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in <B>runtest</B> to
point to your <B>sdl/src/.libs</B> and your <B>dri/i686</B>
directories.  Then run <B>runtest</B> preferrably by remote login from
another computer.<P>

Hit a key to quit the program.  It doesn't restore the console so
you'll have to reboot to get it back.<P>


<P>

<HR><P>

<H1>CHANGES:</H1><P>

<B>081201</B>: Initial release.  64MB Radeon only.<P>


<B>082201</B>: This should theoretically support Radeons with 32MB as
well as 64MB. C++ as well as C programs should now compile for FBDRI. Some
functions not implemented in 081201 should now work. Also the waiting
and cache flushing was disabled from the DRM kernel module. This speeds
it up by 10% without appearing to cause any problems.<BR>

<HR><P>


<H1>BUILDING FOR FBDRI:</H1>
<P>


If you plan to develop for FBDRI the include directories are different:<P>

<B>sdl/include</B> - SDL header files<BR>
<B>dri/include/GL</B> - OpenGL header files<BR>


<P>
You must use these include files instead of the traditional system
includes because the SDL structures are different sizes to support
FBDRI and the GL functions were mapped directly to FBDRI using macros,
not assembly language symbol redirection like X Windows.<P>

You must link the following libraries:<P>

<B>dri/i686/libglfb.so</B><BR>
<B>sdl/src/.libs/libSDL.so</B>

<P>

<HR><P>


<H1>PORTING NOTES:</H1>
<P>

Unlike XF86DRI where you had a lot of functions to pointers indirecting
95% of the calls, FBDRI ports should rely on symbol reuse.  Future
FBDRI ports should rename the RADEON*, drmRadeon, etc calls to generic
DRIVER, and drmDriver calls, thus by linking different object files for
DRIVER and drmDriver functions you eliminate indirection and make the
code much easier to read.  The <B>FBMesa</B> calls already do this.<P>




<P>


We've taken all the relevant DRI code from the XFree86 tree and
assembled it in the dri directory.  A single top-level Makefile
compiles everything in all the dri subdirectories except
<B>os-support/linux/drm/kernel/</B>.<P>

"FBDRI_Main *dpy" replaces all "Display *dpy" and most of the
visual/screen/drawable instances for now.<P>

Currently some of the variables are hard coded to speed up the FB
porting.  Variables like PCI bus ID.<P>

Wherever an X structure is needed, values are set in the FBDRI_Main
structure, to be initialized in the FBDRIScreenInit command.  This is
called by whatever initializes the framebuffer console, in our case
SDL.<P>

All X11 dependancies which can't be removed have to be implemented
in the FBDRI_Main object.<P>

Spagetti for sending requests to the X Server are gone.<P>

Version checking is gone, probably to be reintroduced later.<P>

The kernel level driver is straight from
<B>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel</B>. 
Minor changes are done to improve verbosity and work around some X
Server dependancies.<P>

<HR><P>

<B>Mappings between the X11 dri directories and the FB dri directories.</B><P>


We try to adhere to the original directory structure to minimize
confusion.<P>

</TABLE>

<P>

You'll find that the driver specific definitions tend to stay in <P>

<B>dri/lib/GL/mesa/src/drv</B> - user-space XF86DRI driver<P>
<B>dri/os-support/linux/drm/kernel</B> - kernel-space XF86DRI driver<P>
<B>dri/drivers/</B> - segments of the XFree86 2D driver required by DRI<P>
<P>

The dri source code documentation, except for the Jens Owen parts, is
pretty bad, with many indirections making it hard to follow.  Most of
the indirections should be eliminated in FB dri and a monolithic libglfb.so
binary created for each card.<P>

fbdri.c: These were previously client side requests in

	then dispatched to pure DRI calls. These should be replaced by the
	pure DRI calls.

radeon_dri.c: Initializes the hardware.

SDL_fbvideo.c: Initializes the function that initializes the hardware.

glfbcmds.c, glfbext.c: Front end to the GL subsystem.  Functions
usually start with "glFB"  Initializes the OpenGL specific stuff.

dri_mesa.c: the front end to the front end of the GL subsystem.  Entry
points used to initialize the system.  Functions usually start with
"dri"

radeon_fbmesa.c: Entry points initializing card specific portions of
the DRI objects.  Usually start with "FBMesa"
